## Phishing

**Definition:**  
A fraudulent attempt to obtain sensitive information (login credentials, credit card data) by pretending to be a trustworthy entity, usually via email or fake websites.  

**Why it matters:**  
Still the #1 attack vector for breaches. User awareness is the first line of defense.

---

## Smishing

**Definition:**  
Phishing attempts conducted via SMS messages.  

**Why it matters:**  
Growing attack type as users increasingly trust mobile messages. Often used for fake delivery notices or bank alerts.

---

## Social Engineering

**Definition:**  
The use of psychological manipulation to trick individuals into divulging confidential information or performing actions that compromise security.  

**Why it matters:**

Exploits human behavior, not technology. Harder to patch, requires awareness training.

---

## Silent Fix

**Definition:**  
When a vendor updates or changes a product to remediate a bug, vulnerability, or unintended behavior **without officially acknowledging** that an incident occurred.  

**Why it matters:**  
Protects vendor reputation, but reduces transparency. SOC analysts should always compare vendor statements with observed changes.

---

## Incident Report

**Definition:**  
A structured record of a suspected or confirmed security or privacy event, including timeline, impact, and resolution.  

**Why it matters:**  
Provides accountability, supports learning, and can serve as evidence for audits or regulatory inquiries.

---

## Zero-Day

**Definition:**  
A vulnerability in software or hardware that is unknown to the vendor and therefore has **zero days of protection** or patches available.  

**Why it matters:**  
Highly valuable to attackers. Disclosure and patch management processes are critical.

---

## Triage

**Definition:**  
The process of quickly assessing incoming alerts or incidents to determine severity, scope, and priority.  

**Why it matters:**  
SOC analysts face alert overload; triage ensures resources are spent on real threats.

---

## IOC (Indicator of Compromise)

**Definition:**  
A piece of forensic data (IP address, domain, file hash, registry key, etc.) that indicates a system may have been breached.  

**Why it matters:**  
Helps analysts detect, investigate, and block malicious activity.

---

## False Positive

**Definition:**  
An alert that suggests malicious activity but is actually benign.  

**Why it matters:**  
Too many false positives waste analyst time and can hide real threats in the noise.
