## I. 🧠 Key Concepts

### 🎭 Scam

A fraudulent scheme meant to trick you into giving up personal data, money, or access.

### 🕵️‍♂️ Social Engineering

Psychological manipulation that exploits human behavior and trust to extract sensitive information or gain unauthorized access.

### 📩 Phishing

A scam technique using fake emails or websites to steal login credentials or private data.

---

## II. 📬 Common Attack Channels

- **Email** – Fake recruiters, banking alerts, malicious links or attachments
- **LinkedIn** – Scam recruiters using generic job offers and Gmail addresses
- **Messaging apps** – Building rapport, then sending malicious links or requests
- **Phone/SMS** – Fake call centers, urgent messages asking to call back
- **Lookalike websites** – Slightly misspelled URLs (e.g., g00gle.com)

---

## III. 🎯 Why You?

- Your email is publicly visible
- Viral post increased visibility
- You have a technical profile → assumed system access
- Few contacts → easier to deceive
- No 2FA or password manager → more vulnerable

## IV. 🚨 Red Flags

| Indicator              | Why it's suspicious            |
|-------------------------|--------------------------------|
| Gmail/Outlook sender    | Not a corporate domain         |
| Generic message         | Not personalized               |
| Urgency or pressure     | Emotional manipulation         |
| Refers you to someone else | Classic social engineering tactic |
| Missing company or job title | Very vague approach       |

## V. 🧯 What To Do

- Don’t click, reply, or download anything
- If you did: **change passwords, run malware scan, log out everywhere**
- Enable **two-factor authentication (2FA)**
- Use a password manager (Bitwarden)
- **No shame – just learn from it**

---

## VI. 🛠️ Defense Basics

- Bitwarden → strong, unique passwords
- 2FA on Gmail, LinkedIn, GitHub, etc.
- Hide email visibility on LinkedIn
- Use separate emails for different services
- Delete unused accounts
- Clean `.env` files, API tokens from GitHub

---

## VII. 🧪 Real-World Example (Anonymized)

- Viral post attracted fake recruiters
- One claimed to work with CrowdStrike, used a Gmail address
- Redirected to another “advisor”
- Suspicious profile accepted then removed
- Email visibility turned off, passwords checked (HaveIBeenPwned)
- Bitwarden active, 2FA setup in progress
- **No data loss** → caught early  
- **Case Closed / Resolved** → incident fully documented and mitigated

---

### Spotting a Scam

- [ ] Gmail or Outlook address?
- [ ] Generic message?
- [ ] No company or job title mentioned?
