# 🧠 Incident Report – Facebook Post Duplication  
**Date:** 14-07-2025  
**Analyst:** Viktor Halupka  
**Category:** Platform rendering anomaly / false positive  
**Severity:** Low  
**Status:** Resolved

---

## 🔎 Summary

Multiple duplicate posts were observed across different Facebook groups and feeds within the iOS Facebook app. The duplicated content stacked visually, creating the impression of reposting, automated activity, or a rendering bug.

Importantly: **this behavior did not occur in Facebook Messenger.**

---

## 🧭 Initial Observations

- Platform affected: **Facebook (iOS app only)**
- Symptom: **Duplicate posts/comments** visible across several groups
- Frequency: Appeared rapidly, often in clusters
- Messenger conversations were **not affected**

---

## 🛠️ Investigation Steps

1. ✅ Checked active sessions under `Facebook > Settings > Security`  
   → Only one valid session (iPhone) was active

2. ✅ Verified 2FA was enabled and enforced (Authenticator App)

3. ✅ Confirmed no unfamiliar logins or suspicious devices

4. 🔁 Switched to Messenger and browser version: **no duplication visible there**

---

## 🧪 Root Cause Analysis

Likely a **rendering/cache synchronization issue in the iOS Facebook app**.  
No indication of compromise, scripting, or third-party interference.

🧼 Reinstalling the Facebook app resolved the display duplication.

---

## 🧰 Lessons Learned

- Display anomalies in social media apps may appear malicious but have benign causes
- Always cross-check behavior across other platforms (web, Android, etc.)
- Local cache and app data can cause misleading patterns
- Reinstallation remains a valid first-line remediation

---

## 🏁 Resolution

- ✅ Facebook app reinstalled
- ✅ No duplication observed after reinstall
- ✅ No security issues detected
